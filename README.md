### C - Simple Shell

## PROJECT DETAILS:
This project is an ALX software Engineering project that deals with the production of a simple shell program. From study and understanding a shell is a program that enables user to interphase with theoperating system directly using command line.
Inorder to understand and be able to create this project these basic concepts and how they relate to shell developmeent must be understood.
- Process Identifier and Parent Process Identifier (PID and PPID)

- I/O redirection
- Process Execution
- Waiting and Termination
- Next command prompt.

## GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
The following are requirements for the project
- All files must end with a new line.
- A readme file at the root of the repository
- At most 5 functions per file
- All headers must be included and guarded
- An Azuthors file at the root of the repository
- System call must be used only when necessary
- The shell should not have any memory leaks
- All codes must be written in betty style.

## COMPILATION
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89

## OUTPUT
- Unless specified otherwise, your program must have the exact same output as sh (/bin/sh) as well as the exact same error output.
- The only difference is when you print an error, the name of the program must be equivalent to your argv[0]
